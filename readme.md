# David McArthur T1A3 - Terminal App Documentation

## R1 Answers to all the documentation requirements below
  
## R2 Your README.md should have a separate heading for each documentation requirement and answers organised under the appropriate headings.
  
## R3 Provide full attribution to referenced sources (where applicable)

Formula for calculating BMR: https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html

## R4 Provide a link to your source control repository

## R5 Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to. Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.

## R6 Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include

- at least THREE features
- describe each feature
        Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling
    Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .

### Feature 1: Calculate recommended carb intake based on a range of inputs

Describe: The core of the app will be taking input from the user (weight, height, age, gender and activity level) and outputting their recommmended carb intake.

Includes error handling for ValueErrors, in case user gives bad input.

### Feature 2: Record and save actual daily carbs

Describe: This feature will prompt the user to input their carbs from the past 7 days and save it to a file.

Includes error handling for ValueErrors, in case user gives bad input.

### Feature 3: Report weekly intake compared to recommended goal from F1

Describe: This feature will read the above information and compare it to the recommended output

Includes error handling for ValueErrors, in case user gives bad input.

## R7 Develop an implementation plan which

- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

    Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

    Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan.
    Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

## R8 Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application

You must include:

- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
- how to use any command line arguments made for the application
